# SafeFoods

Safe
Last project for REDBADGE at Eleven Fifty.

SafeFoods app should have a wide database of healthy recipes with less carbs and 0 sugars. Users should be able to search our website for all kinds of meals and desserts made with healthy ingredients .
The next goal would be to transform this SafeFoods into a centralized social media type app, where people of all kinds (chefâ€™s, food bloggers, food critics, any individual passionate about healthy food) can create their profile, share recipes, comment on others posts and also advertise their business .
